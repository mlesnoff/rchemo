\title{LMR-DA models}

\description{

Discrimination (DA) based on linear regression (LMR).

The training variable \eqn{y} (univariate class membership) is transformed to a dummy table containing \eqn{nclas} columns, where \eqn{nclas} is the number of classes present in \eqn{y}. Each column is a dummy variable (0/1). Then, a linear regression model (LMR) is run on the \eqn{X-}data and the dummy table, returning predictions of the dummy variables. For a given observation, the final prediction is the class corresponding to the dummy variable for which the prediction is the highest.

}

\usage{

lmrda(X, y, weights = NULL)

\method{predict}{Lmrda}(object, X, ...) 

}

\arguments{

\item{X}{For the main functions: Training X-data (\eqn{n, p}). --- For auxiliary functions: New X-data (\eqn{m, p}) to consider.}

\item{y}{Training class membership (\eqn{n}).}

\item{weights}{Weights (\eqn{n}) to apply to the training observations for the PLS2. Internally, weights are "normalized" to sum to 1. Default to \code{NULL} (weights are set to \eqn{1 / n}).}

\item{object}{A fitted model, output of a call to the main functions.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments.}

}

\value{See the examples.}
