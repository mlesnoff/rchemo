\title{PLSDA models}

\description{

Discrimination (DA) based on PLS.

The training variable \eqn{y} (univariate class membership) is firstly transformed to a dummy table containing \eqn{nclas} columns, where \eqn{nclas} is the number of classes present in \eqn{y}. Each column is a dummy variable (0/1). Then, a PLS2 is implemented on the \eqn{X-}data and the dummy table, returning latent variables (LVs) that are used as dependent variables in a DA model.

- \code{plsrda}: Usual "PLSDA". A linear regression model predicts the Y-dummy table from the PLS2 LVs. This corresponds to the PLSR2 of the X-data and the Y-dummy table. For a given observation, the final prediction is the class corresponding to the dummy variable for which the prediction is the highest.

- \code{plslda} and \code{plsqda}: Probabilistic LDA and QDA are run over the PLS2 LVs, respectively.

\usage{

plsrda(X, y, weights = NULL, nlv)

plslda(X, y, weights = NULL, nlv, prior = c("unif", "prop"))

plsqda(X, y, weights = NULL, nlv, prior = c("unif", "prop"))

\method{predict}{Plsrda}(object, X, ..., nlv = NULL) 

\method{predict}{Plsprobda}(object, X, ..., nlv = NULL) 

}

\arguments{

\item{X}{For the main functions: Training X-data (\eqn{n, p}). --- For auxiliary functions: New X-data (\eqn{m, p}) to consider.}

\item{y}{Training class membership (\eqn{n}). \bold{Note:} If \code{y} is a factor, it is replaced by a character vector.}

\item{weights}{Weights (\eqn{n}) to apply to the training observations for the PLS2. Internally, weights are "normalized" to sum to 1. Default to \code{NULL} (weights are set to \eqn{1 / n}).}

\item{nlv}{The number(s) of LVs to calculate.}

\item{prior}{The prior probabilities of the classes. Possible values are "unif" (default; probabilities are set equal for all the classes) or "prop" (probabilities are set equal to the observed proportions of the classes in \code{y}).}

\item{object}{A fitted model, output of a call to the main functions.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments. Not used.}

}

\value{See the examples.}
