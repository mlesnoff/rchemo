\title{Heuristic selection of the dimension of a latent variable model with the Wold's criterion}

\description{

The function helps selecting the dimensionnality of latent variable (LV) models (e.g. PLSR) using the "Wold criterion". 

The criterion is the "precision gain ratio" \eqn{R = 1 - r(a+1) / r(a)} where \eqn{r} is an observed error rate quantifying the model performance (msep, classification error rate, etc.) and \eqn{a} the model dimensionnality (= nb. LVs). It can also represent other indicators such as the eigenvalues of a PCA.

\eqn{R} is the relative gain in efficiency after a new LV is added to the model. The iterations continue until \eqn{R} becomes lower than a threshold value \eqn{alpha}. By default and only as an indication, the default \eqn{alpha = .05} is set in the function, but the user should set any other value depending on his data and parcimony objective.

In the original article, Wold (1978; see also Bro et al. 2008) used the ratio of \bold{cross-validated} over \bold{training} residual sums of squares, i.e. PRESS over SSR. Instead, \code{selwold} compares values of consistent nature (the successive values in the input vector \eqn{r}), e.g. PRESS only . For instance, \eqn{r} was set to PRESS values in Li et al. (2002) and Andries et al. (2011), which is equivalent to the "punish factor" described in Westad & Martens (2000).

The ratio \eqn{R} is often erratic, making difficult the dimensionnaly selection. Function \code{selwold} proposes to calculate a smoothing of \eqn{R} (argument \eqn{smooth}).

\usage{
selwold(
    r, indx = seq(length(r)), 
    smooth = TRUE, f = 1/3,
    alpha = .05, digits = 3,
    plot = TRUE,
    xlab = "Index", ylab = "Value", main = "r",
    ...
    )
  }

\arguments{

\item{r}{Vector of a given error rate (\eqn{n}) or any other indicator.}

\item{indx}{Vector of indexes (\eqn{n}), typically the nb. of Lvs.}

\item{smooth}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), the selection is done on the smoothed \eqn{R}.}

\item{f}{Window for smoothing \eqn{R} with function \code{\link{lowess}}.}

\item{alpha}{Proportion \eqn{alpha} used as threshold for \eqn{R}.}

\item{digits}{Number of digits for \eqn{R}.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), results are plotted.}

\item{xlab}{x-axis label of the plot of \eqn{r} (left-side in the graphic window).}

\item{ylab}{y-axis label of the plot of \eqn{r} (left-side in the graphic window).}

\item{main}{Title of the plot of \eqn{r} (left-side in the graphic window).}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass in function \code{\link{lowess}}.}

}

\value{

A list of outputs (see examples), such as:

\item{opt}{The index of the minimum for \eqn{r}.}

\item{sel}{The index of the selection from the \eqn{R} (or smoothed \eqn{R}) threshold.}
